# Stev232sColorGrid

## Description

This program will generate rectangles across a webpage. These rectangles will appear as a different color when hovered over. If the rectangle is click on then the color is cleared from the rectangle.<br><br>

Latest update brings in jQuery to help reduce the size of scripts.js. In this project I will be utilizing jQuery to look for on click events and on hover events. For click events I will be using .on('click', function(event)) line. For on hover events I will be using .hover(function(event)) line.
